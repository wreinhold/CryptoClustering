# CryptoClustering

This was completed as a homework assignment for the UNC Chapel Hill Data Science Bootcamp.

In this assignment, I was tasked to use unsupervised learning to create clusters for a crypto currency dataset. In it, I used tools like KMeans, PCA, and StandardScaler to create this analysis. I scaled the data, created models to find the optimal number of clusters, graphed the scatter plots, and provided feedback on optimal cluster sizes.
